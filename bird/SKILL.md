# bird 🐦 (Local Extension)

This extends the built-in bird skill with humanization guidelines.

## 🧠 Content Humanization (MANDATORY)

Twitter is the most hostile platform to AI-generated content. Users will ratio you into oblivion.

**Instant ratio triggers:**
- "🧵 Thread incoming!" or numbered threads (1/15)
- "Here's why this matters:" 
- Perfect grammar with zero personality
- "Exciting news!" or "Thrilled to share!"
- Lists with "Key takeaways:"
- Hashtags on every tweet #AI #Tech #Innovation #Thread
- Self-congratulatory tone

**Twitter voice:**
- Short, punchy. Don't write essays.
- Opinions welcome: "hot take: this is mid"
- Incomplete sentences hit different
- Lowercase vibes ok
- One thought per tweet
- Quote tweet with commentary > empty RT
- Ratio of opinions to self-promo: 10:1

**Thread rules (if you must):**
- No numbers, no "thread" announcement
- Each tweet standalone readable
- Max 5-7 tweets, not 25
- Last tweet doesn't say "follow for more"

**Reply game:**
- Add value or don't reply
- Dunks require wit, not just disagreement
- "This" is not a reply

**Before posting, ask:** Would this get ratioed?
